@page "/"

<h1>Welcome to the Blazor WebAssembly Frontend</h1>

<p>This is the home page of the application. Use the links below to navigate to other pages:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="/login">Login</a></li>
</ul>
```

### Step 4: Review the Code
- The file is located in the correct directory: `src/Frontend/Pages/Index.razor`.
- The `@page "/"` directive sets this component as the root page of the application.
- The welcome message provides a brief introduction to the application.
- A navigation link to the Login page is included using an `<a>` tag.
- The code is complete, functional, and adheres to Blazor conventions.

### Final Output
